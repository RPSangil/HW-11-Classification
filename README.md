# HW-11-Classification
**Unit 11 - Risky Business**

## The Scenario

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that me to help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

In this assignment I  have built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so I have needed to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. I have uses the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

- <ins> Resampling </ins> - Resampling is a methodology of economically using a data sample to improve the accuracy and quantify the uncertainty of a population parameter.[<sup>1</sup>](reference-list)
- <ins> Ensemble Learning </ins> - Ensemble learning is a method where multiple models are combined into one powerful predictor. In classification instances, the different models might make a final prediction by calculating which class had the most votes or predictions. In regression instances,  the mean of all results is typically taken and then offered as the final prediction.
